				<h2>SoftEng350 Assignment 3</h2>
				<p>
					Created by: Nicholas Weatherburn<br>

				</p>
				<h2>Task 1 a)</h2>
				<img class="standout" src="images/site-flowchat.png" alt="Flowchart for this website" height="600">
				<br>
				<span style="text-align:center;"><em>Note: The square boxes represent web pages and the diagonal boxes represent sections on the 'above' box</em></span>
				<p>
					The main source of navigation for the site is the nav bar at the top of the web page. This nav bar is on every page of the website and has access to the main sections. As well as this the site logo can be clicked to return to the home page (the guides page). 
				</p>
				<p>
					Implemented on this website is the Guides page (which acts as the home page) as well as an article page (found by following either the see more link or title for the carrots article).
					To navigate the home page you can either scroll to various sections or use the side bar. Clicking the links in the sidebar moves the page to the relevant category of articles.
				</p>
				<h2>Task 1 b)</h2>
				<h3>WireFrame</h3>
				<p>
					Hello this is the text and information for <strong>WireFrame</strong>
				</p>

				<h3>Fonts</h3>
				<p>
					In order to maintain a consistent feel throughout the web pages all fonts are a sans-serif font. The reason I chose a sans-serif font over a serif font is partially due to personal preference as well as due to sans-serif fonts being more commonly used on the internet. This helps provide consistency between this website and others. 
				</p>
				<p>
					For commentary text, I use a 14px size font that has 1.4x line spacing. This is to increase readability and legibility of the text. I have chosen to differentiate hyperlinks with an underline as is common on the internet. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The font used for the website logo is also a sans-serif font - DIN Alternate Bold. I have chosen a font here that is very legible and different from the body text. This is so that it is obviously differentiable from the body text, which, I feel commands attention.
				</p>

				<h3>Colour Scheme</h3>
				<img class="standout" src="images/colour-scheme.jpg" alt="Colour Scheme for this website" height="600" align="middle">
				<p>
					<strong>Before the usability test:</strong>
					<br>
					I have chosen a fairly minimalist approach to this colour scheme by only using a small number of colours - all with the same hue. This monochromatic colour scheme, I believe, reflects the earthy tones that is reminiscent of a vegetable garden and thus brings an immediate sense as to what the websites content is. 
					<br>
					The font is a black to provide as much contrast as possible to the background colors aside from where the background color is lighter, where a white text is used. The white text aims at differentiating itself from the body text.
					<br>
					To add some contrast to the site, the logo for the website uses an orange. This contrast provides a point of difference for the sight and draws attention to the site logo.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>After the usability test:</strong>
					<br>
					After the usability test (and after implementation) it became apparent that the colour scheme chosen was far too strong. As such I redesigned the color scheme which is shown as is.
					<br>
					<a href="bad-guides.html"><em>The guides page before the color change can be seen here.</em></a>
					<br>
					The new color scheme is much lighter. And uses a very light green background. As well as this, the color of the sections is now white. The choice for the background color is based of the FaceBook background color (#e9eaed), however with the green and blue components swapped. After this I bumped the green up a little bit and it looked pretty nice (#e9efea). Despite the significant change in appearance, the new colour scheme is more of an incremental update from the original colour scheme.
					<br>
					After implementing the usability test I looked further into choosing colours for a website. I found information suggesting to use a #333333 color for text. <em>(What this is current is)</em>. Supposedly this increases usability and the general aesthetics of a website. This information has come from: <a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/">here</a> and various other websites.
					<br>
					In order to maintain the green in the website, the nav bar is green and the sidebar has green highlights.
					<br>
					When changing the background color of the site I had to change the color of the logo to use #333333 text. Without this change the logo would have been unreadable.
				</p>


				<h3>Lines and borders Scheme</h3>
				<p>
					Between each link on the top navigation bar I have white lines to distinguish where one button starts and another begins. This is useful when a user will use the nag bar as they should always know which section they are clicking on. In addition to this is visually appealing and helps the nav bar stand out slightly.
				</p>
				<p>
					To bring each section <em>off the page</em> I have used a box-shadow around each of the sections of the website (the navbar, footer, sidebar and each article box, etc). This is to give the website a 3D feel and to make it obvious to the user which sections are important. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to make it obvious where each category of videos starts and finishes, I have a horizontal line underneath each section. This has the added bonus of breaking up what may otherwise be a fairly repetitive scheme.
				</p>
				<p>
					To draw attention to the video titles, each article title is underlined with a horizontal line. This allows a user to quickly see the article title and then decide whether they would like to read the short snippet or go into the whole article.
				</p>
				<h3>Assumptions made</h3>
				<p>
					Throughtout the implementation of this assignment I made a few assumptions. Firstly, the purpose of this website is to provide information to patio gardeners. There is a seperate getting started section (not implemented) that would help a user get set up with a patio garden. However, the crux of the website is to provide guides on specific aspects of patio gardening. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To save time during the implementation the only article that is actually implemented is the article on Carrots. The article about carrots is taken from <a href="http://www.organicgardening.com/learn-and-grow/carrots-growing-guide">this page.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to this, for ease of marking the videos that would be viewable on this website are instead just screen captures of what it would look like. This is so that an internet connection is not needed for the marking of this assignment.
				</p>
				<p>
					As well as this, if the website were fully implemented there would be far more videos on the main/guides page. However, to save effort of writing article snippets I have only included four. This means that some sections on the side bar (Fertilization, Irrigation and Tools) do not have any videos, and so are not shown. They still appear on the side bar to give a better view of what the full featured website would look like.
				</p>
				<p>
					It may appear that there is a limited amount of DHTML used on this website. However, for an informational site on Patio Gardens having the user enter information or using drag and drop would be cumbersome and forced into the website. This would likely decrease usability. Examples of DHTML used on this website are the sidebar that follows the user down the webpage. The like article button on the article page. As well as the various mouse over features indicating functionality of the nav and sidebar to the user.
